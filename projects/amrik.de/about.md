Hey, I'm Amrik! I'm a full stack developer based in London.

I make cool things and I write about them here. I'll also be occasionally writing my life in general! It should go without saying that all of the opinions here are my own and potentially completely uninformed!

If you want to get in touch with me, feel free to drop me an email [here](mailto:amrik.singh@live.co.uk)!
