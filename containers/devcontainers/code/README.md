# Code Devcontainer

This devcontainer should give you _every_ tool needed to build _anything_ in this repository.

The base of this image is `ubuntu 20.04` and all dependencies are added on top of that.
Ubuntu is used because it's easy, and supported by just about everything, I might move to `NixOs` in the future but I'm already tinkering with so many new technologies I don't want to do that right now.
